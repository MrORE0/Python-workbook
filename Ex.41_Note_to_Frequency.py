# Begin by writing a program that reads the name of a note from the user and displays the noteâ€™s frequency. 
# Your program should support all of the notes listed previously. Once you have your program working correctly 
# for the notes listed previously you should add support for all of the notes from C0 to C8. 
# While this could be done by adding many additional cases to your if statement, such a solution is cumbersome, 
# inelegant and unacceptable for the purposes of this exercise. Instead, you should exploit the relationship 
# between notes in adjacent octaves. In particular, the frequency of any note in octave n is half the frequency 
# of the corresponding note in octave n + 1. By using this relationship, you should be able to add support for 
# the additional notes without adding additional cases to your if statement.


# we can either make it as a bunch of if statements or a match case statements, or with a simple dictionary
